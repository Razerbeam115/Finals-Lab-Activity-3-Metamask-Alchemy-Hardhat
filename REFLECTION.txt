Doing the coding activity was kinda tough. I hit some problems I couldn't fix. At first, I thought I could figure it out easily. But as time passed, I got more and more frustrated.

When things got hard, I had to decide if I'd give up or keep trying. I chose to keep at it. I looked online for help and asked friends for advice. Turns out, asking for help was a smart move.

Even though it took a while, I finally understood what was going wrong with the code. Every mistake I made taught me something new.

Looking back, even though it wasn't smooth sailing, I'm glad I stuck with it. It taught me patience and the importance of not giving up when things get tough. I learned that getting things right isn't always easy, but it's worth it in the end.
